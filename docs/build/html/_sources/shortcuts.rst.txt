Keyboard Shortcuts
=======================
A number of keyboard shortcuts are available for easy editing and navigation. These are:

- **Ctrl + click**: Holding the *Ctrl* key and clicking on a node will bring that node into focus. This shortcut performs the same function as searching for that node specifically.
- **Shift + click**: Holding down the *Shift* key allows for the selection of multiple nodes by clicking each node. Holding down *Shift* and clicking the background also allows for the selection of nodes in a rectangular area by clicking and dragging over that area.
- **Alt**: Holding down the *Alt* key allows users to select nodes by hovering over them. This allows for fast selection of a large number of nodes.
- **Ctrl + z**: Undo previous action.
- **Ctrl + y**: Redo undone action.
- **Delete**: Delete selected nodes.
- **Arrows**: Move selected nodes in the arrow's direction.
- **a**: Select all graph nodes.
- **b**: Break selected metabolite nodes.
- **c**: Curve edges associated with selected node.
- **d**: Automatically curve edges associated with selected nodes to estimated position.
- **f**: Fix selected node.
- **h**: Highlight selected metabolite node.
- **i**: If a single reaction node is selected, isolate the reaction. If multiple nodes, or a single metabolite node, are selected, isolates metabolites.
- **j**: Join Metabolites.
- **p**: Finds shortest path between selected nodes.
- **q**: If all selected metabolite nodes of degree one are secondary, makes those nodes primary. Otherwise makes all metabolites nodes of degree one secondary.
- **s**: Shelve selected metabolite nodes.
- **t**: Toggle fix status of selected node.
- **u**: Untrap selected node from added shape.
- **p**: Pause simulation.
- **r**: Reload graph.
